# MT lineage tracing
This repository contains custom scripts for the evualuation of the efficacy of mitochondrial lineage tracing under different scenarios.

**simulation**: code for the analysis of simulated data.

**example**: simulated mtDNA mutation matrix files and tree files of different models.

**mutation_calling**: code for the preprocess and mutation calling of real single-cell sequencing datasets.

**SSV**: code for the analysis of subpopulation-specific variants (SSVs) of simulated and experimental datasets.
